**About**

This project is based on the dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/ashkhagan/smile-twitter-emotion-dataset?select=smile-annotations-final.csv which is composed of about 3k tweets.

Two models namely Single layer LSTM (Long short term memory) and Bidirectional LSTM models are used and their accuracy is compared to find out the best model for the analysis in the end with the help of confusion matrix.
